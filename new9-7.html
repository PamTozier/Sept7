    <div font-style="San Serif">
    Once upon a time there was a brat with powers.<br/>
    His mom was a whore and he had no dad<br/>
    She claimed he was <em>spontaneously concieved</em> because she had no <b>relations</b> with anyone<br/>
    BUT, the kid was special no matter his origins. At six year old, he built a droid who had all the information available electronically before anyone else.<p>
        I plan to find a photo to put here of the brat and his droid</p>
